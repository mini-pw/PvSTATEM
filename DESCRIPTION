Title: Reading, quality control and preprocessing of MBA assay data
Description: The package speeds up the process of loading raw data from MBA 
    assays, performs quality control checks and automatically normalizes the data, 
    preparing it for more advanced downstream tasks. The main objective of the 
    package is to create a simple environment for a user, which does not 
    necessarily has experience with R language. The package is developed 
    within the project of the same name - `PvSTATEM` - which is an international 
    project which aims into malaria elimination.
