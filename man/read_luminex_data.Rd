\item{use_layout_types}{Whether to use names from the layout file in extracting sample types.
Works only when layout file is provided}

\item{use_layout_dilutions}{Whether to use dilutions from the layout file in extracting dilutions.
Works only when layout file is provided}

\item{default_data_type}{The default data type to use if none is specified}

\item{sample_types}{a vector of sample types to use instead of the extracted ones}

\value{
Plate file containing the Luminex data
}
\description{
Reads a file containing Luminex data and returns a Plate object.
If provided, can also read a layout file, which usually contains
information about the sample names, sample types or its dilutions.

The function is capable of reading data in two different formats:
\itemize{
\item xPONENT
\item INTELLIFLEX
which are produced by two different Luminex machines.
}
}
