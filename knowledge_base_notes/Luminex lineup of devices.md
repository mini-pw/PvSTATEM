### MAGPIX System 
the most "affordable" ($20K - $35K), compact, some sources say that it is discontinued but support is still provided (accessories etc.), only support for 96 wells plates, lowest throughput, 17.5 kg, full plate in less than 60 mins, Multiplex capabilities 50

### Luminex 100/200 
As far as I know, 200 have replaced 100, both are relatively old products, released before MAGPIX System, labs I checked (mostly in Poland) have either MAGPIX System of Luminex 200, price varies greatly on this one. In theory it should be more expensive than MAGPIX, also support for 96 wells plates, medium throughput. 50 kg, full plate takes 45 mins, Multiplex capabilities 100

### FLEXMAP 3D 
High end, I haven't encounter this one, but it's probably because it's only in highly specialise labs that require this throughput. Support for 96 and 384 wells plates. 77.1 kg, 96-well in ~20 min, 384-well in ~75 min. More than $160K, Multiplex capabilities 500

### xMAP INTELLIFLEXÂ System 
It's hard to find info about this one, I guess it's relatively new product, also support for 96 and 384 wells plates 96-well in ~20 min, 384-well in ~75 min. 54kg, Multiplex capabilities 500

## Multiplex capabilities
Multiplex capabilities means how much antibodies I can measure at the same time (Multiplex capabilities = 1 for ELISA).
