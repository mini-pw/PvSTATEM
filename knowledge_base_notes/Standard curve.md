Think of a standard curve as you think of a ruler, but it's a ruler that you have to create yourself, based on some known values. Standard curve is a concept/tool used to measure concentration or dilution. Unfortunately we can't measure it directly, so we measure the intensity of light, and using a standard curve, we translate the value we know to the value we want to know. 

In many cases it's linear but not in our example. Curve we are trying to fit has logistic shape. Still the sample dilution is estimated the best (with the lowest variance) in a "liner" part of logistic curve.
