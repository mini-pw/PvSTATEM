**Assay** - an experiment where you measure the amount of "something".

**Blank** - special sample type, prepared the same way as all others but without measured substance, used as a way to detect the signal of background.

**Calibration curve** - same as standard curve but used in context of automatic devices.

**Concentration** - amount of a substance (solute) present in a certain volume of solution (solvent). It indicates how much solute is dissolved in the solvent and is usually expressed in various units depending on the context. If you add a small amount of lemon juice to a large amount of water, the lemonade will be weak (low concentration). If you add a lot of lemon juice to a small amount of water, the lemonade will be strong (high concentration).

**Control** - known sample (either know concentration or if it's positive/ negative), used to validate how reliable are our measurements, if results of measurements greatly differs from ground truth, something is wrong, results shouldn't be treated seriously and experiment have to be redone.

**CV** - ~~cross validation~~, coefficient of variation -  a relative measure of dispersion that is used to determine the variability of data.

**Dilution** - typically a number describing the proportion of the volume of the original (concentrated) solution to the total final volume after adding the solvent. This numerical expression can be in the form of a ratio, fraction, or dilution factor. If you mix 1 part juice with 1 part water, you get a 1:1 dilution, making the juice half as strong.

**ELISA** - widely used biochemistry experiment method to detect and quantify substances, typically proteins such as antibodies, antigens and hormones. Examples of usage: Detection of diseases by identifying specific antigens or antibodies (e.g., malaria, hepatitis, COVID-19), measurement of hormone levels (e.g., insulin, hCG).

**LOD** - limits of detection, minimal concentration  at which a measurement has a 95% probability of being greater than zero. (the lowest quantity or concentration of a component that can be reliably detected).

**MAGPIX** - popular device used to measure light intensity, for more head to [[Luminex lineup of devices]].

**MFI** - Mean, or Median, Fluorescence Intensity (value that Luminex devices are measuring).

**Plate** - piece of plastic with multiple wells used as small test tubes. The most popular size is 8x12 (96 wells). 

**Reagents** -  substance added to a system to cause a chemical reaction or test if one occurs.

**Solute** - substance dissolved in another substance (salt in a salty water)

**Solvent** - chemical substance that is used to dissolve or dilute other substances or materials (water in a salty water)

**Standard curve** - think of a standard curve as you think of a ruler. It is a concept/tool used to measure concentration or dilution. We can't measure it directly, so we measure the intensity of light, and using a standard curve, we translate the value we know to the value we want to know. *Sometimes samples used to create standard curve are called standard curve; I know it's stupid, but be aware.* For more details head to [[Standard curve]].

**Test sample** - an actual sample in which we want to measure the concentration or existence of some substance. We cannot measure it directly, but thanks to methods such as ELISA or xMAP, we can translate other measurements into quantity of interest. 

**Well** - small, round or square-shaped indentation or depression on a plate where samples are placed for experimental analysis. Each well acts like a tiny test tube or container. Wells can hold liquids, such as chemical solutions, biological samples, or reagents.

**xMAP** - technology platform developed by Luminex Corporation that enables the simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple analytes (such as proteins, nucleic acids, or other biomolecules) in a single sample. It revolutionises the way researchers and clinicians analyse biological samples by offering high-throughput capabilities and multiplexing abilities.
